# Сonsulting Сontracts Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the financial performance of a consulting services company over the past year. By examining key metrics such as contract revenues, net profit, expense-to-revenue ratio, and the contribution of individual contracts, the goal is to gain insights into the company's operational efficiency, identify top-performing contracts, and assess overall profitability trends. Contracts are just a part of the company's revenue-generating activities; in addition to this, the company also performs other tasks and provides services that contribute to its overall financial results.

## Key Insights:
- **Key products**

## Data Sources
Contracts Data: the primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Contracts.xlsx" containing comprehensive monthly financial details for the one year. This dataset provides a detailed breakdown of the company's contracts and related financial metrics. Each record represents a monthly summary of contract performance with the following key attributes:
- **Contract Amounts:** total value of contracts executed within the month;
- **Revenue:** income generated from the contracts;
- **Operational Expenses:** costs incurred in the fulfillment of contract obligations;
- **Miscellaneous Expenses:** additional expenses not directly related to core operations.

## Tools
- Excel - Calculation & Data Analysis
- Tableau - Calculation & Data Analysis, Data Visualization

## Data Preparation and Quality Improvement
**1. Enhanced Data Quality:** Before analyzing the data, ensured consistency by adjusting column formats to align with the data types, such as standardizing date formats, converting numerical columns to appropriate formats, and ensuring text fields were uniform.

**2. Net Profit:** Calculated by subtracting both operational and miscellaneous expenses from total revenue, providing a clear picture of the company's overall profitability.

**3. Contract Contribution:** Calculated by determining the percentage contribution of each contract’s revenue to the total yearly revenue. It helps to identify the most impactful contracts on overall performance.

**4. Calculated Profit from Contracts:** Calculated by subtracting total expenses (operational and miscellaneous) from revenue of contracts for each month. This metric highlights the net profitability of contracts of each month.

**5. Growth Rate:** Calculated by comparing monthly revenue changes to evaluate the percentage increase or decrease in performance over time. This metric provides insights into revenue trends and business growth dynamics.

**6. Expense-to-Revenue Ratio:** Calculated by dividing total expenses by total revenue, providing insights into the efficiency of the company's spending relative to its earnings.

## Visualization
**1. Contracts and Revenue Amounts:**

1.1. Correlation between revenues and contracts. Analysis of the relationship between revenues and contract amounts indicates a dependence between them. The graph shows that the company receives income not only from contracts. At the same time, the analysis also emphasizes the need to diversify sources of income.

1.2. Trends in revenues and contracts. During the year, the company's revenues show significant fluctuations. For example, August and December stand out as months with the highest revenues and contract amounts. In August, the company reached the highest level of revenues ($500), while the amount of concluded contracts amounted to $148,700. In December, although the revenue was slightly lower ($455), the amount of contracts was even higher — $161. Conversely, there are places with insignificant contract amounts in February $25, March $0, July $25.

1.3. Seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. The dynamics of revenues and contracts also indicate the presence of seasonal or cyclical fluctuations. For example, every two months the contract amounts are higher, and then two months are followed by smaller amounts and one month of lower revenues, indicating a likely decrease in business activity in attracting new clients.
